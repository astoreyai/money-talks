    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Support Forms Because:\n",

    "2. Cost Basis\n",
    "   - Holders who bought at $50 don't want to sell at a loss\n",
    "   - They hold (or buy more) at this level\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Perceived Value\n",
    "   - Price at $50 was previously considered \"fair\"\n",
    "   - Buyers see it as good value again\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Resistance Forms Because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Memory & Relief\n",
    "   - Trapped buyers from $55 want to break even\n",
    "   - When price returns to $55, they sell\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Profit Taking\n",
    "   - Traders who bought lower take profits at $55\n",
    "   - Supply exceeds demand\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Round Numbers\n",
    "   - Psychological barriers ($50, $100, $200)\n",

    "5. Confluence\n",

    "1. **Support and Resistance are foundational** - They represent levels where buying/selling pressure historically concentrates\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Think in ZONES, not lines** - Price reverses within a zone, not at exact prices\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **More touches = stronger level** - Multiple touches without breaking increases significance\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Role reversal is powerful** - Broken support becomes resistance and vice versa\n",
