    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Week 1 Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TTS Qualification**: Must meet all four criteria—substantial activity (500+ trades), regular/continuous pattern, short holdings (<31 days), and significant time (4+ hours/day)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **TTS Benefits**: Business expense deductions, Solo 401(k) up to $69K, health insurance deduction, QBI deduction—can save $30K-$80K+ annually\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **MTM Election**: Eliminates wash sales and $3K loss limit, but converts all gains to ordinary income. Must elect by April 15 prior to effective year.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Documentation**: Critical to maintain detailed records of trades, time spent, and expenses to defend TTS in potential audit\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Decision Framework**: TTS best for full-time active traders with substantial expenses; MTM best for day traders with frequent losses\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Week**: We'll explore trading entity structures (LLC, S-Corp, C-Corp) and how to optimize your business structure for maximum tax efficiency.\n",
