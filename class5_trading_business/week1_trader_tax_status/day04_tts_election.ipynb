    "\n",
    "Today we learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MTM Benefits**: No $3,000 loss limitation, no wash sale rules, and simplified year-end accounting make MTM attractive for active traders\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **MTM Drawbacks**: All income becomes ordinary (no preferential capital gains rates), difficult to revoke, and requires marking all positions to market\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Election Deadline**: Must file election statement by April 15 of the year BEFORE MTM takes effect (existing traders)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Required Forms**: Election statement filed with IRS, Form 3115 for method change, Form 4797 for annual reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Best For**: Active day traders with frequent losses, high wash sale issues, or those wanting simplified accounting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway**: MTM election is a powerful tool for active traders but is essentially permanent. Carefully analyze your trading pattern and expected results before electing.\n",
