    "## What is a Financial Market?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **financial market** is any marketplace where buyers and sellers come together to trade financial assets such as stocks, bonds, currencies, and derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a farmer's market, but instead of vegetables, people are buying and selling ownership in companies, debt instruments, and other financial products.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Functions of Financial Markets:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Function | Description |\n",
    "|----------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Price Discovery** | Markets determine fair prices through supply and demand |\n",
    "| **Liquidity** | Easy to buy/sell assets quickly without major price impact |\n",
    "| **Capital Allocation** | Direct money from savers to businesses that need it |\n",
    "| **Risk Transfer** | Allow participants to hedge or transfer risk |\n",
    "| **Information Aggregation** | Prices reflect collective knowledge of all participants |"

    "## Primary vs. Secondary Markets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Market\n",
    "Where **new securities are issued** for the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Companies raise capital by selling new shares (IPO - Initial Public Offering)\n",
    "- Governments issue new bonds\n",
    "- Money goes directly to the issuer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: When Airbnb went public in December 2020, they sold new shares to raise $3.5 billion. This was a primary market transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Secondary Market\n",
    "Where **existing securities are traded** between investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The stock exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ) are secondary markets\n",
    "- The original issuer doesn't receive money from these trades\n",
    "- Most trading activity happens here\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: When you buy Apple stock through your brokerage, you're buying from another investor, not from Apple. This is a secondary market transaction.\n",
