    "1. **Bid-Ask Spread** is a hidden trading cost - narrower is better\n",
    "2. **Market Orders** guarantee execution but not price\n",
    "3. **Limit Orders** guarantee price but not execution\n",
    "4. **Slippage** can significantly impact large orders\n",
    "5. **Always double-check** order type, side, and quantity before submitting\n",

    "**When to Use Each:**\n",
