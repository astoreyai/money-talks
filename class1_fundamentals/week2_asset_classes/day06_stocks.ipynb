    "If you own 100 shares of AAPL:\n",
    "- You own 100 / 15,500,000,000 = 0.000000645% of Apple\n",
    "- That's a tiny fraction, but you're still a real owner!\n",

    "As an owner, you have:\n",
    "✓ Right to vote on major company decisions\n",
    "✓ Right to receive dividends (if paid)\n",
    "✓ Claim on assets if company liquidates (after creditors)\n",
