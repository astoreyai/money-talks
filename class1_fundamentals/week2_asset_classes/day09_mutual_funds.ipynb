    "- Lower expense ratios (0.03% - 0.20%)\n",
    "- Automatic rebalancing to match index\n",
    "- Goal: Match the benchmark return (minus fees)\n",
    "- Lower portfolio turnover = more tax efficient\n",

    "1. **Mutual funds** pool money from many investors for diversified, professionally managed portfolios\n",
    "2. **NAV** is calculated once daily - you can't trade mutual funds intraday\n",
    "3. **Index funds** (passive) beat most active funds over long periods due to lower fees\n",
    "4. **Expense ratios** compound dramatically - a 1% fee can cost you 28% of your final wealth\n",
    "5. **No-load, low-cost index funds** are the best choice for most investors\n",
