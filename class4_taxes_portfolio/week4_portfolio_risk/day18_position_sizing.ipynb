    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Position Sizing Matters: A Cautionary Tale\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 1: Poor Position Sizing (25% per position)**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Portfolio: $100,000\n",
    "4 positions @ $25,000 each\n",
    "\n",
    "Position 1: -50% loss = -$12,500 (down to $87,500)\n",
    "Position 2: -50% loss = -$12,500 (down to $75,000)\n",
    "Position 3: -50% loss = -$12,500 (down to $62,500)\n",
    "Position 4: +50% gain = +$12,500 (up to $75,000)\n",
    "\n",
    "Result: -25% total loss despite 1 winner\n",
    "Requires: +33% gain just to recover\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 2: Smart Position Sizing (5% per position)**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Portfolio: $100,000\n",
    "20 positions @ $5,000 each\n",
    "\n",
    "15 positions: -10% avg = -$7,500 total\n",
    "5 positions: +100% avg = +$25,000 total\n",
    "\n",
    "Result: +17.5% total gain\n",
    "Risk: Any single loss limited to 0.5% of portfolio\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 1-2% Risk Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Principle**: Never risk more than 1-2% of your total portfolio on any single trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "POSITION SIZE CALCULATION\n",
    "=========================\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "• Portfolio Value: $100,000\n",
    "• Risk per Trade: 1% = $1,000\n",
    "• Stock Price: $50\n",
    "• Stop Loss: $45 (10% below entry)\n",
    "• Risk per Share: $50 - $45 = $5\n",
    "\n",
    "Position Size Calculation:\n",
    "Shares = Risk Capital / Risk per Share\n",
    "Shares = $1,000 / $5 = 200 shares\n",
    "Position Value = 200 × $50 = $10,000\n",
    "\n",
    "Verification:\n",
    "If stopped out at $45:\n",
    "Loss = 200 shares × $5 = $1,000 ✓ (1% of portfolio)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Works:**\n",
    "- Survive multiple losing trades without devastating portfolio\n",
    "- With 1% risk: Can lose 50 trades in a row and still have 60% capital\n",
    "- With 10% risk: 7 losses = -51% (difficult to recover)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kelly Criterion: Optimal Position Sizing\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kelly Criterion calculates the optimal position size to maximize long-term growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "f* = (p × b - q) / b\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "f* = fraction of capital to bet\n",
    "p = probability of winning\n",
    "q = probability of losing (1 - p)\n",
    "b = ratio of win to loss (payoff ratio)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Calculation:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Trading System:\n",
    "• Win rate: 60% (p = 0.6)\n",
    "• Average win: $600\n",
    "• Average loss: $400\n",
    "• Payoff ratio: b = 600/400 = 1.5\n",
    "\n",
    "Kelly %:\n",
    "f* = (0.6 × 1.5 - 0.4) / 1.5\n",
    "f* = (0.9 - 0.4) / 1.5\n",
    "f* = 0.5 / 1.5 = 0.333 or 33.3%\n",
    "\n",
    "Fractional Kelly (safer):\n",
    "Half Kelly = 16.7% per position\n",
    "Quarter Kelly = 8.3% per position\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Notes:**\n",
    "- Full Kelly is aggressive (high volatility)\n",
    "- Most traders use 1/4 to 1/2 Kelly\n",
    "- Requires accurate estimates of p and b\n",
    "- Overestimating edge = over-betting = ruin\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concentration Risk: Maximum Position Limits\n",

    "**Common Position Sizing Rules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "POSITION SIZE GUIDELINES\n",
    "========================\n",
    "\n",
    "Portfolio Size    Max Single Position    Number of Positions\n",

    "Others               10% max each\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Danger of Concentration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example: Enron Employees (2001)\n",
    "• Average 401k: 60% in Enron stock\n",
    "• Company bankruptcy: Stock $90 → $0.26\n",
    "• Result: Employees lost jobs AND retirement\n",
    "• Lesson: Never concentrate >10% in ANY stock\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Tech Bubble (2000-2002)\n",
    "• Portfolio: 80% tech stocks\n",
    "• Nasdaq peak to trough: -78%\n",
    "• Recovery time: 15 years to break even\n",
    "• Lesson: Sector diversification essential\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Position Sizing for Different Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Long-Term Buy and Hold**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Strategy: Index fund investing\n",
    "Position Size: Equal weight or market cap weight\n",
    "Rebalancing: Annual or threshold-based\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Portfolio ($100k):\n",
    "• S&P 500 Index: 40% ($40,000)\n",
    "• International Index: 20% ($20,000)\n",
    "• Bond Index: 30% ($30,000)\n",
    "• REIT Index: 10% ($10,000)\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk Management: Diversification through indexing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Stock Picking**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Strategy: Individual stock selection\n",
    "Position Size: 3-5% per stock\n",
    "Portfolio: 20-30 stocks minimum\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Calculation:\n",
    "Portfolio: $100,000\n",
    "Per position: $3,000-$5,000\n",
    "Stop loss: 20% below entry\n",
    "Max risk per trade: 1% = $1,000\n",
    "\n",
    "If $5,000 position with 20% stop:\n",
    "Actual risk = $5,000 × 0.20 = $1,000 ✓\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Swing Trading**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Strategy: Short-term trades (days to weeks)\n",
    "Position Size: 5-10% per trade\n",
    "Risk per Trade: 1% of portfolio\n",
    "Number of Positions: 5-10 concurrent\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Portfolio: $50,000\n",
    "Risk per trade: $500 (1%)\n",
    "Entry: $100, Stop: $95 (5% stop)\n",
    "Risk per share: $5\n",
    "Shares: $500 / $5 = 100 shares\n",
    "Position value: $10,000 (20% of portfolio)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Options Trading**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Strategy: Options for speculation\n",
    "Position Size: 1-2% max per trade\n",
    "Total Options Allocation: 5-10% of portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Portfolio: $100,000\n",
    "Max options allocation: $10,000\n",
    "Per trade: $1,000-$2,000\n",
    "Trades: 5-10 small positions\n",

    "Note: Options can go to zero; size accordingly\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Position Sizing Mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mistake 1: Equal Dollar Amounts Without Risk Adjustment**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Wrong: \"I'll invest $10,000 in each stock\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem:\n",
    "• Stock A: $100, stop at $95 (5% risk)\n",
    "• Stock B: $50, stop at $40 (20% risk)\n",
    "• Both $10k positions have very different risk!\n",
    "\n",
    "Right: Adjust position size based on stop distance\n",
    "• Stock A: $10,000 position (5% risk = $500)\n",
    "• Stock B: $2,500 position (20% risk = $500)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mistake 2: Averaging Down on Losers**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Wrong: Buy $5k at $100, buy another $5k at $80\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem:\n",
    "• Now have $10k in losing position\n",
    "• Doubled down on what market says is wrong\n",
    "• Concentration risk increased\n",
    "\n",
    "Right: Cut losses at stop, move on\n",
    "• Exit at stop loss (e.g., $95)\n",
    "• Take small loss, preserve capital\n",
    "• Find better opportunity\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mistake 3: Let Winners Become Too Large**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Scenario:\n",
    "• Started with 5% position\n",
    "• Stock quadrupled (4x)\n",
    "• Now 20% of portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk:\n",
    "• Single stock now dominates portfolio\n",
    "• One bad earnings = huge portfolio hit\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "• Trim winners back to maximum position size (5-10%)\n",
    "• Lock in profits, reduce concentration\n",
    "• Redeploy capital to underweight positions\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mistake 4: Ignoring Correlation**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Wrong: \"I have 20 positions, I'm diversified\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Reality Check:\n",
    "• 15 tech stocks\n",
    "• 3 tech ETFs\n",
    "• 2 tech sector funds\n",
    "• All highly correlated (move together)\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective diversification:\n",
    "• Different sectors\n",
    "• Different asset classes\n",
    "• Low correlation between holdings\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced: Volatility-Adjusted Position Sizing\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjust position size based on volatility to equalize risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "VOLATILITY ADJUSTMENT\n",
    "=====================\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Risk: 1% of portfolio\n",
    "Portfolio: $100,000\n",
    "Target Risk $: $1,000\n",
    "\n",
    "Stock A:\n",
    "• Price: $100\n",
    "• Daily Volatility: 1% ($1/day)\n",
    "• Position Size: $1,000 / 1% = $100,000\n",
    "• Too large! Cap at 10% = $10,000\n",
    "\n",
    "Stock B:\n",
    "• Price: $50\n",
    "• Daily Volatility: 5% ($2.50/day)\n",
    "• Position Size: $1,000 / 5% = $20,000\n",
    "\n",
    "Result: Lower volatility → larger position\n",
    "        Higher volatility → smaller position\n",
    "        Each position has similar risk profile\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Position Sizing Psychology\n",
    "\n",
    "**Emotional Challenges:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)**\n",
    "   - Temptation to oversize \"can't miss\" opportunities\n",
    "   - Solution: Stick to position limits, no exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Revenge Trading**\n",
    "   - After loss, want to \"make it back quickly\"\n",
    "   - Solution: Maintain constant position size regardless of recent results\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Confidence Bias**\n",
    "   - Feel certain about a trade → oversize position\n",
    "   - Solution: Remember that certainty ≠ correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Loss Aversion**\n",
    "   - Size positions too small out of fear\n",
    "   - Solution: Use systematic rules, not emotions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disciplined Approach:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Define risk per trade BEFORE entry (1-2%)\n",
    "2. Calculate position size mathematically\n",
    "3. Execute without emotion\n",
    "4. Set stop loss immediately\n",
    "5. Log trade in journal\n",
    "6. Review results weekly/monthly\n",
    "7. Adjust rules based on data, not feelings\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **1-2% Risk Rule**: Never risk more than 1-2% of your total portfolio on any single trade. This ensures you can survive extended losing streaks and protects your capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Position Size Formula**: \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Shares = Risk Capital / Risk per Share\n",
    "   where Risk per Share = Entry Price - Stop Loss\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Adjust position size based on stop distance to equalize risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Kelly Criterion**: Optimal position sizing for maximum growth, but use fractionally (1/4 to 1/2 Kelly) to reduce volatility. Requires accurate win rate and payoff ratio estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Concentration Limits**:\n",
    "   - Single position: 5-10% maximum\n",
    "   - Sector allocation: 25% maximum\n",
    "   - Trim winners that exceed limits\n",
    "   - Diversify across 20-30+ positions\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Common Mistakes to Avoid**:\n",
    "   - Equal dollar amounts without risk adjustment\n",
    "   - Averaging down on losers\n",
    "   - Letting winners become too concentrated\n",
    "   - Ignoring correlation between holdings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Position Sizing Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Before Every Trade:\n",
    "□ Calculate 1-2% risk amount in dollars\n",
    "□ Set stop loss price\n",
    "□ Calculate risk per share (entry - stop)\n",
    "□ Determine number of shares (risk $ / risk per share)\n",
    "□ Verify position doesn't exceed 10% of portfolio\n",
    "□ Check sector concentration (< 25%)\n",
    "□ Enter position with stop loss\n",
    "□ Log trade in journal\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Position Size Calculation:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Risk Amount = Portfolio Value × Risk %\n",
    "2. Risk per Share = Entry Price - Stop Price\n",
    "3. Shares = Risk Amount / Risk per Share\n",
    "4. Position Value = Shares × Entry Price\n",
    "5. Verify: Position Value < 10% of Portfolio\n",
