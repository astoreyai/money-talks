    "```\n",
    "CASH-SECURED PUT TRADE MANAGEMENT\n",
    "=================================\n",
    "\n",
    "OPENING THE TRADE:\n",
    "1. Identify stock you WANT to own\n",
    "2. Choose strike at your target price\n",
    "3. Sell put, collect premium\n",
    "4. Hold cash for potential assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "STRIKE SELECTION:\n",
    "- Support levels make good strikes\n",
    "- 5-10% below current price typical\n",
    "- Lower strike = less premium but cheaper buy\n",
    "\n",
    "EXPIRATION SELECTION:\n",
    "- 30-45 days optimal\n",
    "- Enough time value\n",
    "- Not too long commitment\n",
    "\n",
    "MANAGEMENT:\n",
    "If stock rises:\n",
    "- Put expires worthless, keep premium\n",
    "- Sell another put\n",
    "\n",
    "If stock falls to strike:\n",
    "- Get assigned, buy shares\n",
    "- Start selling covered calls!\n",
    "\n",
    "If stock crashes:\n",
    "- Buy shares at strike\n",
    "- Loss = (Strike - Market) - Premium\n",
    "- But you wanted to own anyway!\n",
    "\n",
    "CAPITAL REQUIRED:\n",
    "Cash = Strike Price × 100\n",
    "$165 strike = $16,500 cash needed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Put Selling Risks\n",

    "```\n",
    "CASH-SECURED vs NAKED PUTS\n",
    "==========================\n",
    "\n",
    "CASH-SECURED PUT (Acceptable risk):\n",
    "- Have cash to buy shares\n",
    "- If assigned, you own stock\n",
    "- Max loss = Strike - Premium (stock to $0)\n",
    "- Requires margin or cash\n",
    "\n",
    "NAKED PUT (Higher risk):\n",
    "- Don't have full cash\n",
    "- Using margin leverage\n",
    "- Margin calls possible\n",
    "- Same theoretical max loss\n",
    "- But capital efficiency different\n",
    "\n",
    "KEY RULE:\n",
    "Only sell puts on stocks you would\n",
    "HAPPILY own at the strike price!\n",
    "\n",
    "WORST CASE EXAMPLE:\n",
    "Sell $50 Put for $2\n",
