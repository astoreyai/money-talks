    "\n",
    "#### 1. Opening Range Breakout (ORB)\n",
    "```\n",
    "OPENING RANGE BREAKOUT\n",
    "======================\n",
    "\n",
    "Concept: Trade breakouts from the first 15-30 minute range\n",
    "\n",
    "SETUP:\n",
    "1. Wait for first 15-30 minutes\n",
    "2. Mark the high and low of that range\n",
    "3. Enter on breakout above high (long) or below low (short)\n",
    "4. Stop loss: Opposite side of range\n",
    "5. Target: 1.5-2x the range size\n",
    "\n",
    "EXAMPLE:\n",
    "  Opening Range: $150.00 - $151.00\n",
    "  Range Size: $1.00\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Long Entry: Above $151.00\n",
    "  Stop Loss: $149.75 (below range - buffer)\n",
    "  Target: $152.50 (1.5x range)\n",
    "\n",
    "       $152.50 ----------- TARGET\n",
    "           |\n",
    "       $151.00 =========== BREAKOUT (Entry)\n",
    "           |   Opening\n",
    "       $150.00 =========== Range Low\n",
    "           |\n",
    "       $149.75 ----------- STOP LOSS\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. VWAP Bounce\n",
    "```\n",
    "VWAP BOUNCE STRATEGY\n",
    "====================\n",
    "\n",
    "Concept: Trade bounces off VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)\n",
    "\n",
    "LONG SETUP (Uptrending Day):\n",
    "1. Price is above VWAP (bullish bias)\n",
    "2. Price pulls back TO VWAP\n",
    "3. Wait for bounce/rejection candle\n",
    "4. Enter long on confirmation\n",
    "5. Stop below VWAP\n",
    "6. Target: Previous high or 2x risk\n",
    "\n",
    "SHORT SETUP (Downtrending Day):\n",
    "1. Price is below VWAP (bearish bias)\n",
    "2. Price rallies TO VWAP\n",
    "3. Wait for rejection candle\n",
    "4. Enter short on confirmation\n",
    "5. Stop above VWAP\n",
    "6. Target: Previous low or 2x risk\n",
    "\n",
    "WHY IT WORKS:\n",
    "- VWAP = institutional average price\n",
    "- Institutions defend their average\n",
    "- Creates natural support/resistance\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Morning Momentum\n",
    "```\n",
    "MORNING MOMENTUM STRATEGY\n",
    "=========================\n",
    "\n",
    "Concept: Ride stocks with strong pre-market movement\n",
    "\n",
    "SCANNER CRITERIA:\n",
    "- Gap up/down > 3% from previous close\n",
    "- Pre-market volume > 500K\n",
    "- News catalyst (earnings, upgrade, FDA)\n",
    "- Relative volume > 2x normal\n",
    "\n",
    "ENTRY:\n",
    "1. Stock gaps up with catalyst\n",
    "2. Wait for first pullback (3-5 min)\n",
    "3. Enter when pullback holds above VWAP\n",
    "4. Or enter on break of pre-market high\n",
    "\n",
    "EXAMPLE:\n",
    "  Previous Close: $50.00\n",
    "  Pre-market High: $55.00 (10% gap)\n",
    "  Open: $54.00\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Trade 1: Buy pullback at $53.00 (holds VWAP)\n",
    "  Trade 2: Buy breakout above $55.00\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Stop: Below VWAP or below low of day\n",
    "  Target: Extension levels ($57, $60)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Red-to-Green / Green-to-Red\n",
    "```\n",
    "RED-TO-GREEN MOVE\n",
    "=================\n",
    "\n",
    "Concept: Stocks that reverse from negative to positive\n",
    "\n",
    "SETUP (Long):\n",
    "1. Stock opens red (below previous close)\n",
    "2. Price action shows buying\n",
    "3. Stock crosses above previous close\n",
    "4. Enter on break of previous close\n",
    "5. Stop below recent swing low\n",
    "\n",
    "PSYCHOLOGY:\n",
    "- Trapped shorts must cover\n",
    "- Creates short squeeze pressure\n",
    "- Momentum attracts buyers\n",
    "\n",
    "        Previous Close\n",
    "    -------- $50.00 ---------- ENTRY (Break above)\n",
    "             |\n",
    "          Opens RED\n",
    "             |\n",
    "         $49.00 (Low)\n",
    "             |\n",
    "         Reverses UP\n",
    "             |\n",
    "    -------- $50.00 ---------- CROSSES GREEN\n",
    "             |\n",
    "         $51.50 (Target)\n",

    "### Day Trading Risk Management\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "THE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK\n",
    "=============================\n",
    "\n",
    "ACCOUNT RULES:\n",
    "  Daily Loss Limit: 2% of account max\n",
    "  Per Trade Risk: 0.5-1% of account\n",
    "  Max Trades/Day: 3-5 quality setups\n",
    "  Max Losers: 3 losses = stop trading\n",
    "\n",
    "EXAMPLE ($25,000 Account):\n",
    "  Daily Loss Limit: $500 (2%)\n",
    "  Per Trade Risk: $125-250 (0.5-1%)\n",
    "  Max Losing Day: 3 trades x $167 = $500\n",
    "\n",
    "POSITION SIZING FORMULA:\n",
    "  Shares = Risk Amount / (Entry - Stop)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Risk: $200\n",
    "  Entry: $50.00\n",
    "  Stop: $49.50\n",
    "  Shares = $200 / $0.50 = 400 shares\n",
    "  Position Size: $20,000 (80% of account)\n",
    "\n",
    "SCALING:\n",
    "  - Scale in: Add to winners only\n",
    "  - Scale out: Take partial profits\n",
